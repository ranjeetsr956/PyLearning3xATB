#Develop a Python script that calculates the square and cube of a given number. num = 2 sq - 4, c = 8
# Get the number from the user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Calculate the square of the number
sq = num ** 2

# Calculate the cube of the number
c = num ** 3

# Print the results
print(f"The square of {num} is {sq}")
print(f"The cube of {num} is {c}")
