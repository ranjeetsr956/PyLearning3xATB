#1. Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.

# Answer : The = operator and the == operator in Python serve different purposes:
#Assignment Operator (=):
#The  =  operator is used to assign a value to a variable.It creates a reference to the object on the right-hand side and assigns it to the variable on the left-hand side.Example: x = 5
#Equality Operator (==):
#The == operator is used to compare two operands and check if they are equal
# It returns True if the operands are equal, and  False otherwise.
#Example:  x = 5
#y = 5
#print(x == y)  # Output: True<p></p>



#2. What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
#Answer :  The ** operator is used to raise a number to a power.
#he expression a ** b evaluates to a raised to the power of b
#print(2 ** 3)  # Output: 8 (2 raised to the power of 3)
#print(5 ** 2)  # Output: 25 (5 raised to the power of 2)

#The ** operator is commonly used in mathematical and scientific computations, where raising numbers to powers is a frequent operation. It's also used in various algorithms and formulas that involve exponentiation.

#3. What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
#Answer : In Python, the ^  operator is the bitwise XOR operator. It is used to perform a bitwise XOR operation on the corresponding bits of two integers.
#The ^ operator is commonly used in the following contexts:
#Checking Bit Differences
#Masking Bits
#Implementing Algorithms
