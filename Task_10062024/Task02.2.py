#Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

if num1 > num2:
    print(f"{num1} is greater than {num2}")
elif num1 < num2:
    print(f"{num1} is less than {num2}")
else:
    print(f"{num1} is equal to {num2}")
